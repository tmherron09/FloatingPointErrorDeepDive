# FloatingPointErrorDeepDive
Personal Interest- Ran into floating point rounding error and played around with it.

This was just a project I put together after finding the error and exploring what caused it, where I could replicate it and what would be possible solutions.

It includes several examples (which were relevant to original code that was run in Unity). This includes several projects targeting different frameworks, 
including a static class you can pop into any Unity project and call directly to test.
